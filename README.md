1. In the following code cell, you're provided a list of approved usernames, stored in a variable named username_list. Your task is to complete the body of the list_to_string() function. Recall that the body of a function must be indented. To complete the function body, write a loop that iterates through the elements of the username_list and displays each element. Then, call the function and run the cell to observe what happens. <br/>

2. This time, in the definition of the list_to_string() function, add a comma and a space (", ") after each username. This will prevent all the usernames from running into each other in the output. Adding a comma helps clearly separate one username from the next in the output. Adding a space following the comma as an additional separator between one username and the next makes it easier to read the output. Then, call the function and run the cell to observe the output. <br/>
